--- abstract
This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
in the Offset Codebook Mode (OCB) of operation within Transport Layer Security
and Datagram TLS (DTLS) to provide confidentiality and data origin authentication.
The AES-OCB algorithm is highly parallelizable, provable secure and can be
efficiently implemented in software and hardware providing high performance.
